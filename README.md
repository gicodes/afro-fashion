# Afro Fashion

- is a react application designed for e-commerce: Africa's original fashion marketplace.
- This app is built on React.JS & Node.JS, npm v18, Bootstrap, custom sass, material ui, firebase/ firestore and paystack (pending)
- This app is deployed on netlify - https://afrofashionng.netlify.app/

## How to Start App

- Make sure you are in the correct working directory - `cd` into the project root folder `Afro-fashion-main/`
- To install the projects required packges and dependencies, run `npm install`
- Once the packages are installed and your package.json file is updated, to start the app, run `npm start`

## Render Structure

- The routing and UX of this app's UI depends on the tree structure and data flow.
- The responsiveness and UI of this app depends on 2 screen sizes-- `lg` (often referred to as _Desktop_ throughout the App )and `sm` (_Mobile_).
- The rendering and component lifecycle of this app also depend on `react` and `react-router-dom.`
- Rewriting "create-react-app" default config, App.js is rendered inside the _index.js_ file like so;

  _import App from './App' ;_

  _ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
  .render(
  <React.StrictMode>
  `<BrowserRouter>`
  `<UserProvider>`
  `<CategoriesProvider>`
  `<CartProvider>`
  `<App />`
  `</CartProvider>`
  `</CategoriesProvider>`
  `</UserProvider>`
  `</BrowserRouter>`
  </React.StrictMode>
  );_

- In this application, App.js is nested under CartProvider and uses her context for the UX.
- CartProvider is nested under CategoriesProvider and uses her context for the app data UI.
- CategoriesProvider is nested under UserProvider and uses her context for user-session-log.
- UserProvider is nested under BrowserRouter and uses her memory to navigate the entire app.
- BrowserRouter is rendered by React.StrictMode- StrictMode wraps and sets the component tree.
