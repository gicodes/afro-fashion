#DO NOT IGNORE !!!

#Compiling...
#One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
#"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
#declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
#"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
#node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

#babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
#is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
#ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
#your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
#go away.
